An application that parses the folder structure of a project extracts all the classes and methods within them and how they interact with each other. A more involved automatic UML diagram is generated from the current state of the project. The intended users of this program are those exploring open source projects and are curious about the system design.





DATA PIPELINE
==============================
1. Ingest repo
  With GitHub API
  Given a GitHub URL
    exclude
      node_modules
      dist, build
      test folders
    Detect language(s)
    Gate input size, or this will lead to DDoS

2. Analyze structure
    With TypeScript compiler API
    (this already parses the Javascript and knows JS classes and functions)

3. Extract relationships
  Classes
    Name
    Methods
    Fields
    Visibility (public/private/protected)
    Static vs instance
  Relationships
    Inheritance (extends)
    Interface implementation
    Composition (field of another class)
    Aggregation (constructor param types)
    Dependency (method param / return types)
  Functions outside classes
    group into a module


4. internal data structure
  type UMLClass = {
    name: string
    methods: UMLMethod[]
    fields: UMLField[]
    extends?: string
    implements?: string[]
  }

  type UMLDiagram = {
    classes: UMLClass[]
    relations: UMLRelation[]
  }

5. Build a language-agnostic model
  Render UML
    options: Graphviz (DOT), Dagre, or ELK
    UML model -> graph -> layout engine -> positioned nodes
  
6. Export to PDF
  SVG first
  Render UML as SVG in browser
  Export SVG -> PDF
